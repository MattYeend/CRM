### Commit Conventions
To keep the commit history clean and consistent, please follow these conventions:
```graphql
#issue-number Short, clear description in the imperative mood
```

Examples
```graphql
#42 Add customer export feature
#87 Fix validation for lead creation
#101 Refactor role permission checks
```

Guidelines:
- Reference an issue number where applicable
- Use the imperative mood (“Add”, not “Added”)
- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Avoid bundling unrelated changes into a single commit
Maintainers may squash commits on merge.

---

### Maintainer Merge Strategy
For clarity and transparency:
- External contributors do not merge directly
- All changes enter the project via Pull Requests
- Pull Requests are reviewed before merging
- The preferred merge method is Squash and Merge
- Keeps `main` and `develop` history clean
- One commit per feature or fix
- Commit message may be edited by maintainers
The `main` and `develop` branchs is protected and should never be pushed to directly.
